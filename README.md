## Identification Of Issue:

This marketplace was created to allow for faster access to a wide range of Japanese car parts within Australia. There are a large amount of car parts manufacturer websites, and if you want parts from all different websites/manufacturers there is a lot of ordering and shipping fees that apply for the parts.



## Why Is It  A Problem That Needs To Be Solved?

It is a problem that needs to be sold because there are a large number of car parts manufacturers in Australia and world wide, and all of these manufacturers have different websites with many different products. If a customer wants parts from different manufacturers they will have to order many parts from many different website which will cause a lot of hassle as it all the important details are all over the place on different websites. This is why Aus JDM Parts was created to allow a market place where all brands and parts come together to allow for a better user experience and ease of information about orders.
